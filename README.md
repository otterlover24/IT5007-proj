# Time-travel Stock Picking Simulator
- API key just remove
- Fork off public repo, maybe even raise pull request.
- Set up meeting between 23-30th to demo working code
- Ideas for extension
	- Make it a game (multiplayer leaderboard)
		- Interface to search on google, but restrict information date.
			- Google has such an option.
## Deployment Instructions
- Run code in docker exposing `localhost:3000`.
- Run `npm install` to install the necessary node packages.
- Create a .env file in the backend folder to include the following configuration secrets (you may use the secrets I provided, but please keep the SECRET_KEY and VANTAGE_KEY confidential):
	- MONGODB_URI: URI of MongoDB database
	- SECRET: secret key used for password hasing 
	- VANTAGE_KEY: API kvbar, click on `Register` link and create new user.
- Log in as new user via the `Sign in` link on Navbar.
- You may view the page mockups for News, Trade, Watchlist, Porfolio pages.
- Watchlist page has been partially implemented. You may enter ticker to add to watchlist. The quotation will then be reflected in the table below. (You may have to refresh the page, I will fix this in the submission.)

## Notes to Tutor
- I had tried to learn AlphaVantage API requests, authentication, and charting but failed when I tried to put them together from scratch and that set me back by about a week. To meet this first stage submission deadline, I had to base my work off an existing working project and edit from there. The code here is modifed from a public domain Github project https://github.com/SaenthanP/Finance-Tool. You may also view the git logs to see the original and my subsequent changes.
- I wonder how much changes I have to make to avoid running afoul of plagarism rules or to not be penalized for initially starting off from someone else's project. I think there are many elements which will make the work substantially my own, as well as several other technical changes which I can make to make my work less derivative:
	- Element of time-travel simulation.
	- Element of relevant news.
	- Stock market instead of crypto.
	- Use `fetch` instead of `Axios` for API calls.
	- Use `HashRouter` instead of `react-router-dom`.
	- Use single GraphQL endpoint instead of interacting with multiple endpoints.
	
	- Use another charting library instead of `chart.js`.
- To get past CORS error
  	1. Go to chrome://flags/#block-insecure-private-network-requests
  	2. Set Block insecure private network requests to Disabled

- Simulate time step
	- Month saved in MongoDB for each account.
	- Can view for past months, but only act on current month.
	- Range depends on max history from AlphaVantage.
		- 8 years + current date
		- Earliest is latest EOM - 8 years + 1 month
		- Set start of simulation to 2014-06-30 to be safe
			- When creating account, set month to 2014-06
		- Each account has 3 time variables, to be stored in users collection.
			- `beginMonth`: Beginning of simulation
			- `latestMonth`: Latest month
			- `viewingMonth`: Viewing month
	- Add widget with current month, back 1 month, back to beginning, forward 1 month, forward to most recent month to navbar.
		- {DONE} Navbar to get `beginMonth`, `latestMonth`, `viewingMonth` from server.
			- {FIXED} Why all undefined?
				- {SYMPTOM} MongoError: FieldPath cannot be constructed with empty string.
					- {HYPOTHESIS} Maybe sent over request when user was not yet logged in and therefore req._id variable was empty, and then MongoDB crashed.
						- {DONE, SOLUTION} navbar.component to only send request when logged in.
					- {HYPOTHESIS} _id not in user.model
						- {SOLUTION} search using uersname 
		- Buttons to forward `latestMonth` and to alter `viewingMonth` on navbar
		- {DONE} Change time-step to quarter
			- Change navbar buttons, function names, and API endpoints only.
		- {DONE} App to pass time-variables to all props.
	- /watchlist page display adjusted monthly closing price as at month
- Transactions
	- Buy
	- Sell

- Porfolio
	- Similar to watchlist
		- Compute P&L
		- Chart securities over time
  
- Compute P&L

- Fetch News
	- Find free financial news API
		- AlphaVantage has fundamentals
